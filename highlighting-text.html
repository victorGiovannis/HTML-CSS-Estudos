    <p>So, I went back and read the instructions myself to see what I’d done wrong. They said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Remove the tray from the box. Pierce the overwrap several times with a fork and cook on High for <mark>15 minutes</mark>, rotating it half way through.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I thought he'd told me <em>fifty</em>. No wonder it exploded in my microwave.</p>

    <p>It's bad practice to use a class name that describes how an element should look, such as the highlighted portion of CSS below:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            <mark>.greenText</mark> {
                color: green;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
</body>
